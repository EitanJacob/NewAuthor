The above histograms show that Shakespeare tends to use words of slightly greater length than Dickens.
In both of Shakespeare's works, Hamlet and Macbeth, he most often used a word length of four, while Dickens used a word length of three most often in both Tale Of Two Cities and Great Expectations.
